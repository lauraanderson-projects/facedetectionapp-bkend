Note:
HEADS UP! Sometimes the Clarifai Models can be down or not working as they are constantly getting updated. A good way to check if the model you are using is up, is to check them on the Clarifai website. For example, for the Face Detect Mode: https://www.clarifai.com/models/face-detection. If that isn't working, then that means you will have to wait until their servers are back up.
